# Projects 
1. Tableau Dashboards :
   Developed interactive dashboards in Tableau to visualize and analyze different datasets. The dashboards provide insights into fitbit fitness dataset various trends and patterns in the data.
2. Python Data Analysis :
   Performed data analysis using Python, utilizing libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly to manipulate, analyze, and visualize data.
3. Python Web Scraping and Frog Leap Game :
   Web Scraping: Implemented web scraping scripts in Python to collect data from various websites.
   Frog Leap Game: Developed a simple frog leap game using Python. (Only code based no UI).
4. SQL Projects :
   Used SQL for querying data in projects, including the capstone project on fitbit dataset and a murder mystery problem.
5. NumPy Data Collection and Sorting :
   Collected and sorted data using NumPy, demonstrating proficiency in handling large datasets and performing numerical operations.
6. Pandas Data Cleaning and Manipulation :
   Cleaned and manipulated data using Pandas, showcasing skills in data preprocessing and transformation.
7. Data Visualization :
   Visualized data using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly to create informative and visually appealing charts and plots.
8. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) :
   Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a real-world dataset (Fitbit data), analyzing and uncovering insights from big data.
